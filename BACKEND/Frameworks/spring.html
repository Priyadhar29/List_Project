    <h2>What is Spring Framework?</h2>
<p>Spring is a lightweight and popular open-source Java-based framework developed by Rod Johnson in 2003. It is used to develop enterprise-level applications. <br>It provides support to many other frameworks such as Hibernate, Tapestry, EJB, JSF, Struts, etc. so it is also called a framework of frameworks. Itâ€™s an application framework and IOC (Inversion of Control) container for the Java platform. The spring contains several modules like IOC, AOP, DAO, Context, WEB MVC, etc.</p>

    <h2>Why to use Spring?</h2>
    <p>Spring framework is a Java platform that is open source.  <br>Rod Johnson created it, and it was first released under the Apache 2.0 license in June 2003. When it comes to size and transparency, Spring is a featherweight. Spring framework's basic version is about 2MB in size. <br> The Spring Framework's core capabilities can be used to create any Java program, however there are modifications for constructing web applications on top of the Java EE platform.  <br>By offering a POJO-based programming model, the Spring framework aims to make J2EE development easier to use and to promote good programming habits.</p>
